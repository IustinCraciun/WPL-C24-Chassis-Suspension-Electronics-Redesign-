# WPL-C24-Chassis-Suspension-Electronics-Redesign-
This project started as a complete redesign of a WPL C24 remote-controlled car. I designed a custom chassis featuring a cantilever (push-rod) suspension system to significantly improve its off-road capabilities. The electronics were changed entirely(except for the servomotor).The only original part remaining from the WPL C24 is the cab.

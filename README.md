This project started as a complete redesign of a WPL C24 remote-controlled car. I designed a custom chassis featuring a cantilever (push-rod) suspension system to significantly improve its off-road capabilities. The electronics were changed entirely(except for the servomotor):
An Arduino Pro Micro as the main controller
An RC receiver for input signals
A BTS7960 motor driver for high-current motor control
A 7.4V / 3400mAh Li-ion battery pack for extended runtime
A LM2596 DC to DC converter, for powering the Arduino Pro Micro with stabilized 5V

I also upgraded the drivetrain by installing a high-torque motor with a metal gearbox for better performance and durability. The only original part remaining from the WPL C24 is the cab.
